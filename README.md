# Entyde
This is a website I built for a concept product I my friends and I were working on during Freshman and Sophomore years as undergraduates.  The concept is a portable CO2 sensing device that could be used in ambulances to monitor patient breathing.
Though the project is now discontinued, I keep the website up to show something that I worked on in the past and to showcase HTML skills.
